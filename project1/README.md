## Project Description

It's time to play Connect Four! That family friendly classic that incorporates strategy and cunning to defeat the opponent!

Create a game of Connect Four for two competing players. The players will be able to place a game piece into the game board and have that move give them feedback. Each player will be able to place a piece into the gameboard until a winner is announced! The game will include a CSS animation that will reward whomever reaches the unltimate goal of placing four pieces in a row!

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min


#### MVP 


// - Start Game
Add eventListener for moves


// - Switch Turns
If else statements {}


// - Pieces played in cells remain in place.


// - Display Message for player’s turns


Track Player’s turn and alert to moves.

Check for winner (number of ways to win)

Game reset



#### PostMVP 



add CSS animation that rewards winner with a game piece changing and becoming very special!

GAME COMPONENTS.

User should be able to drop an individual piece into a designated cell
 
When a piece is played the next player will choose the next cell and move to desired cell.
Visual feedback of player moves should be indicated.

Once a player has placed four pieces in a row the game is over and a winner will be announced.
		 
Once a winner has been declared the game will reset and be able to play again.


Anticipated Challenges:

  Getting js to be fully functional and able work without bugs.
  
  Having all desing elements work with DOM elements properly.
  





Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
